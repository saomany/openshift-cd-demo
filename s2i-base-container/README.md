Installation
---------------
To build a S2I base image, choose either the CentOS or RHEL based image:
*  **RHEL based image**

    This image is available in Red Hat Container Registry. To download it run:

    ```
    $ podman pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/s2i-base-rhel7
    ```

    Or

    ```
    $ podman pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/s2i-core-rhel7
    ```

    To build a RHEL based S2I base image, you need to run the build on a properly
    subscribed RHEL machine.

    ```
    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/sclorg/s2i-base-container.git
    $ cd s2i-base-container
    $ git submodule update --init
    $ make build TARGET=rhel7 VERSIONS=base
    ```

*  **CentOS based image**

    This image is available on DockerHub. To download it run:

    ```
    $ podman pull centos/s2i-base-centos7
    ```

    Or

    ```
    $ podman pull centos/s2i-core-centos7
    ```

    To build a S2I base image from scratch run:

    ```
    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/sclorg/s2i-base-container.git
    $ cd s2i-base-container
    $ git submodule update --init
    $ make build TARGET=centos7 VERSIONS=base
    ```

Note: while the installation steps are calling `podman`, you can replace any such calls by `docker` with the same arguments.

**Notice: By omitting the `VERSIONS` parameter, the build/test action will be performed
on all provided versions of S2I base image.**
